# tag-generator
This algorithm generates tag that you can use in any social Media platform

The Process are:-
1. I use NLTK(Natural Langauge Toolkit) to generate synonyms and hyponym
Synonyms:- It is a word, morpheme, or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word, morpheme, or phrase in the same language.
Hyponym:- In linguistics and lexicography, hyponym is a term used to designate a particular member of a broader class. For instance, daisy and rose are hyponyms of flower.
2. Then i use Loop to generate one by one synonyms and hyponyms of that given word
